# 🧠 PROJECT CONTEXT – Sport & Health Marketplace

**Production :** application en ligne sur **https://mysportally.com** (configuration domaine, Vercel, Resend : `docs/DOMAIN_MYSPORTALLY_SETUP.md`).

## 1. Product Vision

This project is a web platform that connects:

- **Athletes** (amateur or competitive)
- **Sports & health professionals:**
  - Coach (primary focus today)
  - Strength & conditioning coach, Physiotherapist, Nutritionist (future)

The goal is to build a **SIMPLE**, **ACCESSIBLE**, and **SCALABLE** product that allows athletes to:

- Find a coach easily
- Send a coaching request (with chosen offer)
- Follow a structured training program
- Track their progress
- Communicate with their coach

This is a **marketplace + coaching platform**.

The product must remain minimal and focused on real value.

---

## 2. Core Product Philosophy

Always prioritize:

- Simplicity over complexity
- MVP-first thinking
- Clean UX
- Mobile-friendly design
- Clear separation between roles (athlete, coach, admin)
- **Bilingual (FR/EN):** any new user-facing text must be translated from day one (next-intl; see `docs/I18N.md`)
- Scalable but not over-engineered architecture

Avoid:

- Over-complex systems
- Premature optimization
- Enterprise-level architecture too early
- Feature bloat

## 4. Core Features (Current State)

### 4.0 Dashboard (entry point) ✅

Opening `/dashboard` redirects to a **role-specific default page** (no content rendered on `/dashboard` itself):

| Role | Redirect to |
|------|-------------|
| Athlete with coach | `/dashboard/calendar` |
| Athlete without coach | `/dashboard/find-coach` |
| Coach | `/dashboard/athletes` |
| Admin | `/admin/members` |

The pages **« Trouver mon coach »** and **« Mes athlètes »** are **separate routes** (`/dashboard/find-coach`, `/dashboard/athletes`), each with its own loading skeleton. Sidebar links point directly to these routes; the dashboard layout and `DashboardPageShell` are used for both. The **profile tile** at the bottom of the sidebar (avatar + name) uses the same **selected state** as other nav items (green background, white text) when the user is on the profile page (`/dashboard/profile`); when the sidebar is collapsed (desktop), only the avatar is shown and centered.

---

### 4.1 Authentication ✅

- Email/password (Supabase Auth)
- Role selection at signup (athlete or coach)
- Confirmation email (Supabase template) : bilingue FR/EN via metadata locale au signup ; en-tête avec logo et nom « My Sport Ally ». Voir `docs/AUTH_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`.
- Password reset
- No OAuth in MVP (Strava is integration-only, not login)

---

### 4.2 Coach Profiles ✅

**Included:**

- Name, photo (avatar)
- Bio (presentation)
- Specialties / sports coached (course_route, trail, triathlon, velo)
- Languages (fr, en, es, de, it, pt, nl, zh)
- Postal code
- Offers (title, description, price, type)
- Display order and featured flag for offers

**Not implemented:**

- Online vs in-person
- Other professional types (physio, nutritionist)

---

### 4.3 Search & Discovery ✅

Athletes filter coaches by:

- Sport coached
- Language

**Not implemented:**

- Online / in-person filter
- Price range filter

---

### 4.4 Offers ✅

**Structure:**

- Title
- Description
- Price
- Type: `free` | `monthly` | `one_time`
- `display_order`, `is_featured`

**Offer status (lifecycle):**

| Status | Visibility | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **draft** | Coach only | Work in progress; price/title/description can be incomplete. Not visible to athletes. Not selectable in a coach request. |
| **published** | Athletes + coach | Live offer. Shown in the coach’s 3 main slots (by `display_order` 0–2) and in discovery. Athletes can choose it when sending a request. At most 3 published offers per coach. |
| **archived** | Coach only | No longer available for new requests. Shown in a separate “Archived offers” list for the coach. Existing subscriptions linked to this offer (via snapshot) are unchanged. |

- A coach can **publish** a draft once the required fields are filled (titres FR/EN, descriptions FR/EN, price, recurrence). **After publication, price and price type are non-editable:** a DB trigger rejects any update to `price`/`price_type` when `status = 'published'`; the coach UI shows the pricing as read-only (compact line + “Non modifiable” badge). A confirmation modal before publishing states that the price will not be editable and that only typos in title/description can be fixed afterwards. When saving the form, the server omits `price` and `price_type` from the update payload for published offers.
- A coach **archives** an offer instead of deleting it (no delete policy); new athletes cannot select it, but current subscriptions keep their frozen snapshot.

**Flow:**

- When the athlete opens the coach detail modal (« Voir le détail »), the app checks whether the athlete’s profile has **first name and last name**. If either is missing, the request form inside the modal displays **Prénom** and **Nom** (required, with *). The « Envoyer la demande » button stays disabled until offer, sports, coaching need and (when shown) first name and last name are filled. On submit, the profile is updated with the name if needed, then the request is created. The coach always sees the athlete’s name on pending requests (from `profiles`).
- Athlete sends a **coach request** (sport practiced, coaching need, optional offer_id; first/last name ensured as above).
- While the request is **pending**, the coach tile shows « Annuler la demande » (danger) and « Demande envoyée > » (muted). Clicking « Demande envoyée > » opens a modal with the request detail (frozen offer, sports, message, date); the athlete can cancel the request from the tile or from the modal (same confirmation flow).
- If the request fails (server error or DB insert rejected), the user sees a generic error message and the submit button is no longer stuck on « Envoi en cours »; errors are logged server-side for diagnosis.
- When an offer is chosen, the server immediately stores a **snapshot** of that offer in `coach_requests`: `offer_id`, `frozen_price`, `frozen_title`, `frozen_description`. This is the version of the offer **as seen by the athlete** at request time. If the coach later changes or archives the offer, the request row does not change.
- Coach accepts or declines the request. On the « Mes athlètes » page, **pending requests** are shown in a unified tile per request: athlete avatar, sport badges, full coaching-need message (full width), offer line (title + price). Actions: **« Discuter »** (opens the chat overlay targeting that athlete), **« Refuser »** and **« Accepter »** (each opens a confirmation modal before calling the API). On mobile, the three buttons are at the bottom of the tile (Discuss full width, Decline and Accept side by side).
- **On accept:** (1) `profiles.coach_id` is set (athlete linked to coach), (2) `coach_requests.status` → `accepted`, (3) a row is inserted into **`subscriptions`** with the same `frozen_*` data copied from `coach_requests` (the subscription is **not** filled from the current `coach_offers` table). Thus the active subscription between athlete and coach reflects the exact offer the athlete requested; if the coach changes the offer afterwards, existing subscriptions are unchanged.
- No Stripe/payment yet — subscription model is structural only (billing history ready via `subscriptions.frozen_*`).

---

### 4.5 Workouts (Training Programs) ✅

**Current structure (flat, not hierarchical):**

- **Workout** = one session per date
  - `athlete_id`, `date`, `sport_type`, `title`, `description`
  - Targets: `target_duration_minutes`, `target_distance_km`, `target_elevation_m`, `target_pace`
  - Athlete: `athlete_comment`, `athlete_comment_at`

**Sport types:** course, musculation, natation, velo, nordic_ski, backcountry_ski, ice_skating

**Athlete can:**

- View workouts in calendar
- Mark session with comment
- See imported Strava activities alongside planned workouts

**Coach can:**

- Create / update / delete workouts for their athletes
- On the calendar (workout tile and day modal), see at a glance when an athlete has left a comment on a workout (comment icon in the metadata row: duration, distance, etc.)
- See weekly totals per sport and planning status (“Planifié jusqu’au”, “En retard”)

**Calendar (responsive):** On viewports &lt; 768px (breakpoint md), the athlete and coach calendar pages show a two-line header (title then week selector), the **weekly totals block** (total time volume + per-sport bars, same as the extended week on desktop), then a single week with days stacked vertically; from 768px, the desktop layout (three weeks, 7-column grid) is used. Spec archived in `docs/archive/calendar-mobile-44/`. Weekly-totals-on-mobile design archived in `docs/archive/calendar-mobile-weekly-total/`.

**Not implemented:**

- Program → Weeks → Days → Sessions → Exercises hierarchy
- Exercises with sets, reps, load, media

---

### 4.6 Messaging ✅

- 1-to-1 chat: Athlete ↔ Coach
- One conversation per coach–athlete pair
- Simple text messages (no attachments, no rich formatting in MVP)
- Chat access is request-driven: conversation can be started when a `coach_request` is `pending`, and remains available in read-only when sending is no longer allowed.
- **Latest writable request:** When there is a **new** pending request or a **new** active (or cancellation_scheduled) subscription after a previous decline or ended subscription, the coach and athlete can write again. The app updates the conversation’s `request_id` to the latest writable request for the pair (listing and sendMessage both ensure this); RLS allows participants to update `conversations.request_id` (policy `conversations_update_participant`, migration 048).
- Conversation write access rules:
  - `pending` request: coach and athlete can read/write.
  - `accepted` request: read/write only while linked subscription is `active` or `cancellation_scheduled`.
  - `declined`, cancelled/deleted request, or accepted request with cancelled subscription: conversation remains readable, sending is blocked (read-only) **until** a new writable request exists for the pair.
- Coach can start a conversation from the chat overlay by opening the athlete list and selecting an athlete (conversation is created if needed).
- Athlete can also start/select a conversation from the same overlay pattern (list + sidebar + panel) when multiple coach requests exist.
- Overlay states (coach and athlete):
  - state 1: no open conversation → contact list
  - state 2a/2b: open conversations in sidebar + conversation panel
  - state 3: "Ouvrir une discussion" view (contact list + search)
- Mobile (`< md`): list/conversation navigation with back button. Desktop (`>= md`): sidebar + panel.
- Closing a conversation removes it from the local "open conversations" list in overlay (persisted while navigating inside dashboard pages).

---

### 4.7 Goals ✅

- Athlete defines race/event (date, race_name, distance, is_primary)
- Coach has read-only access to athlete goals
- Displayed as “Prochain objectif” on coach dashboard

---

### 4.8 Coach Ratings & Reviews ✅

- Athlete rates coach (1–5) with optional comment
- One rating per athlete–coach pair (can be updated)
- Aggregated stats (average, count) visible on coach profile for discovery

---

### 4.9 Strava Integration ✅

- Athlete connects Strava (OAuth)
- Activities imported into calendar
- Weekly totals per sport (imported activities)
- Separate “Mes appareils connectés” (devices) section

---

### 4.10 Subscription view, end, and cancellation scheduled ✅

**Athlete (Mon Coach):**

- Bloc « Ma souscription » shows frozen offer (title, description, price/type, dates).
- Button « Mettre fin » opens confirmation modal. For **monthly** subscriptions, ending schedules the subscription end at next cycle → status becomes « En résiliation » (amber badge), line « Fin prévue le {date} » (same line as « A débuté le »).
- Button « Annuler la résiliation » is shown **only to the person who requested the cancellation** (stored in `cancellation_requested_by_user_id`). The other party sees nothing in that slot.
- Sidebar: « Historique des souscriptions » → `/dashboard/subscriptions/history` (past subscriptions, read-only).

**Coach:**

- Mes athlètes: click on subscription line opens detail modal (same content as « Ma souscription » + athlete name). Badge Active or « En résiliation »; button « Mettre fin » or « Annuler la résiliation » (latter only for the requester; otherwise optional hint « Seule la personne ayant demandé… »).
- Page Souscriptions (`/dashboard/subscriptions`): **three sections** — (1) **Souscriptions actives** (green left border), (2) **En résiliation** (amber left border), (3) **Historique** (grey). Same rule: only the requester can use « Annuler la résiliation ».

**Rules:**

- **Immediate end (free / one_time):** `subscriptions.status = 'cancelled'`, `end_date = now`, `profiles.coach_id = null` for the athlete.
- **Monthly:** On « Mettre fin », set `status = 'cancellation_scheduled'`, `end_date` = next cycle, `cancellation_requested_by_user_id` = current user. At `end_date`, a daily cron sets `status = 'cancelled'` and `profiles.coach_id = null`.
- **Cancel cancellation:** Allowed only when `auth.uid() === cancellation_requested_by_user_id`; then `status = 'active'`, `end_date = null`, `cancellation_requested_by_user_id = null`.

## 5. Data Model (Current)

**Main entities:**

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `profiles` | User profile, role, coach_id, coached_sports, languages, presentation, avatar, postal_code |
| `coach_offers` | Coach offers (title, description, price, price_type). Status: `draft` (coach only) / `published` (3 slots, visible to athletes) / `archived` (coach only, no new requests). |
| `coach_requests` | Athlete → Coach request (status: pending / accepted / declined). When offer is chosen: `offer_id` + snapshot `frozen_price`, `frozen_title`, `frozen_description` (offer as seen by athlete at request time). |
| `subscriptions` | Subscription per accepted request: `athlete_id`, `coach_id`, `request_id`, same `frozen_*` copied from `coach_requests` (not from offers). `status`: `'active'` \| `'cancellation_scheduled'` \| `'cancelled'`. `cancellation_requested_by_user_id` (UUID, nullable): user who requested the scheduled cancellation; only they can cancel the cancellation. Used for billing history; unchanged if coach later changes the offer. |
| `workouts` | Planned training sessions for an athlete |
| `goals` | Athlete race/event objectives |
| `conversations` | 1-to-1 coach–athlete. Includes `request_id` (source `coach_requests` row) used to determine chat write access lifecycle. Participants can update `request_id` to the latest writable request (RLS policy `conversations_update_participant`). |
| `chat_messages` | Messages in a conversation |
| `coach_ratings` | Athlete rating + comment for coach |
| `athlete_connected_services` | Strava OAuth tokens |
| `imported_activities` | Activities from Strava |
| `workout_weekly_totals` | Precomputed weekly totals (planned) |
| `imported_activity_weekly_totals` | Weekly totals (imported) |

## 6. Technical Guidelines

- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Auth, DB, RLS), **next-intl (i18n FR/EN)**
- **Folder structure:**
  - `/app/[locale]` — localised routes (dashboard, admin, login, etc.)
  - `/app/api`, `/app/auth` — API and auth callbacks (not localised)
  - `/components` — shared components
  - `/messages` — fr.json, en.json (translations)
  - `/utils` — auth, Supabase clients
- **i18n:** Application is bilingual (French default, English). **Every new feature must be translated from day one** — use next-intl, no hardcoded user-facing strings. See `docs/I18N.md`.
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth, server-side `getCurrentUserWithProfile()`, `requireRole()`
- **Security:** RLS on all tables, role-based policies
- **Stripe:** Not implemented yet; schema is payment-ready

**Avoid:**

- Overusing global state
- Complex microservices
- Unnecessary design patterns

---

## 7. UX Principles

- Minimal UI
- Clean layout
- **Couleurs :** utiliser en priorité les tokens du design system (`tailwind.config.ts`) : `palette-forest-dark`, `palette-forest-darker`, `palette-olive`, `palette-sage`, `palette-gold`, `palette-amber`, `palette-strava`. Ne pas introduire de couleurs en dur (hex).
- Clear hierarchy
- Dashboard-centric navigation
- Mobile-friendly sidebar
- **Bilingual:** French (default) and English — all UI and messages via next-intl; new features must include translations (see `docs/I18N.md`).

---

## 8. Design System

**Documentation complète :** `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

Le design system garantit la cohérence visuelle et la maintenabilité du code. Toujours privilégier les composants et tokens existants.

### Composants disponibles

- **Button** : 8 variantes (primary, primaryDark, secondary, outline, muted, ghost, danger, strava)
- **Input / Textarea** : Champs de formulaire avec états unified (disabled, readOnly, error)
- **Badge** : Étiquettes pour sports (avec icônes SVG), langues, statuts
- **SportTileSelectable** : Tuiles cliquables/sélectionnables (profil, filtres)

### Tokens clés

- **Couleurs** : `palette-forest-dark`, `palette-olive`, `palette-sage`, `palette-gold`, `palette-amber`, `palette-danger`, `palette-strava`
- **Sports** : Icônes SVG centralisées dans `lib/sportStyles.ts`
- **Rayons** : `rounded-full` (badges), `rounded-2xl` (cartes), `rounded-xl` (inputs), `rounded-lg` (boutons)
- **Ombres** : `shadow-sm` (cartes), `shadow-lg` (hover), `shadow-xl` (modales)

### Guidelines

1. **Utiliser les composants** plutôt que des styles inline
2. **Utiliser les tokens** plutôt que des valeurs en dur
3. **États disabled/readOnly** : fond gris (`bg-stone-100`), texte gris (`text-stone-500`)
4. **Hiérarchie typographique** : `text-2xl font-bold` (H1), `text-lg font-bold` (H2), `text-sm` (body)

### Page Design System

Accessible aux admins : `/dashboard/admin/design-system`

Affiche tous les composants, variantes, et exemples d'utilisation.

---

## 10. Instructions for AI Assistants (Cursor)

When generating code:

- **Couleurs :** privilégier les tokens de la palette (`palette-forest-dark`, `palette-olive`, etc.) — pas de valeurs hex en dur.
- **i18n :** toujours penser bilingue — pas de texte utilisateur en dur ; utiliser next-intl et `docs/I18N.md`.
- Prioritize simplicity
- Deliver MVP solutions first
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Keep components reusable
- Keep database normalized
- Ensure role-based access control (RLS)
- Write clean and maintainable code
- Follow existing patterns (e.g. server actions, Supabase client)

**Never:**

- Add complex enterprise patterns
- Over-design the system
- Add features not explicitly requested
- Break role separation
- Introduce new global state unless necessary
- Add hardcoded user-facing strings (always use next-intl; see `docs/I18N.md`)

The product must remain **simple**, **accessible**, **scalable**, and **bilingual (FR/EN)**.
